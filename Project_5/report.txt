Some obstacles that I overcame in my program were making sure that planets were not being double counted and setting up a program that ran multiple files.

Pseudocode:

====Start of Program===

Function runOneRound
	Check and return -1 for any invalid parameters
	copy the word that needs to be guessed from the array of c-strings into a c-string named secret
	Create a loop that keeps running until the word is guessed
		prompt user to enter in a trial word
		make sure word is valid or known, print error statement if needed
		create an array of booleans to track for stars in planets
		iterate through each string and compare for stars
		Note which positions are stars in the array of booleans
		Iterate through the strings again, checking for planets and making sure the characters are not paired in the array of booleans
		if the guess is all stars, then end the round
		print out approprate statements after each guess
		
Main Routine
	Load the words into an array of cstrings
	check for invalid varaibles
	ask the user how many rounds to play
	check if the rounds is positive
	select a random word index in the array of c-strings
	print out how many letters the word is
	for each round, call runOneRound
	at the end of each round, print out how many tries it took and calculate min, max, and average
