1) When the program asked "How many registered voters were surveyed? ", I input 999999999999. This caused the following response to output:
How many of them say they will probably vote for Trarris? How many of them say they will probably vote for Hump?
-40.0% say they will probably vote for Trarris.
-40.0% say they will probably vote for Hump.
Hump is predicted to win the election.

This bahvaior was unexpected/unusual

2)In logic_error.cpp, the error I introduced was switching the line "if (forTrarris > forHump)" into "if (forTrarris < forHump)." The change from the greater than sign to the less than sign reverses the result of the election from expected.

The following is an example:
How many registered voters were surveyed? 100
How many of them say they will probably vote for Trarris? 60
How many of them say they will probably vote for Hump? 30

60.0% say they will probably vote for Trarris.
30.0% say they will probably vote for Hump.
Hump is predicted to win the election.

3)I deleted "int" from line 9, and I also changed "cout" to "cou" in line 13. Both cause the program to not compile.

The compiler gives the following errors:
1>C:\CS31\Project_1\compile_error\compile_error\compile_error.cpp(9,2): error C2065: 'numberSurveyed': undeclared identifier
1>C:\CS31\Project_1\compile_error\compile_error\compile_error.cpp(13,2): error C2065: 'cou': undeclared identifier
1>C:\CS31\Project_1\compile_error\compile_error\compile_error.cpp(14,9): error C2065: 'numberSurveyed': undeclared identifier
1>C:\CS31\Project_1\compile_error\compile_error\compile_error.cpp(20,43): error C2065: 'numberSurveyed': undeclared identifier
1>C:\CS31\Project_1\compile_error\compile_error\compile_error.cpp(21,37): error C2065: 'numberSurveyed': undeclared identifier

Both of these errors related to undeclared identifier. The type of numberSurveyed was not declared and cou does not come with the C++ standard library. THe compiler does not know how to handle them and gives errors.
