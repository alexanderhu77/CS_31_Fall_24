Some obstacles that I faced were writing all the different if statements and making sure my comparisons were accurate. For example, it was easy to confuse < with <= or > with >=. 
Also, figuring out how to account for the different schedule of charges based on different conditions was challenging. Many if statements were used for this.


Some test data:
Negative starting odometer (-1,100,3,test,n,10)
Ending odometer reading is less than the starting reading (2,1,3,test,n,10)
Negative rental days (1,2,-1,test,n,10)
Empty string for customer name (1,2,1,,n,10)
Luxury status is not y or n (1,2,1,test,r,10)
Luxury status is capital Y (1,2,1,test,Y,10)
Month number is below 1 (1,2,1,test,y,0)
Month number is above 12 (1,2,1,test,y,13)
Total miles below 100 (1,2,1,test,y,1)
Total miles between 100 and 600 in Winter (1,500,3,test,n,3)
Total miles between 100 and 600 not in Winter (1,500,3,test,n,4)
Total miles above 600 (1,1000,6,test,y,5)
Customer name has spaces in it (100,1200,9,A Customer,n,10)
Final charge is a whole dollar (100,1200,9,test,n,10)
